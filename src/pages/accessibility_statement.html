            <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
            
            <p>Welcome to the official website of ASCE and AIDIAS (Association of Students of Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence Developers & Innovative Students Association) at Government Polytechnic Ch. Sambhajinagar.</p>
        
            <p>We strive to provide a valuable and user-friendly website experience for our visitors. However, this website is not designed or optimized for use by individuals with visual impairments, including those who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies for website navigation.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Limitations in Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Our website does not include the following accessibility features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Alternative text (alt-text) for images and non-text content</li>
                <li>Screen reader compatibility for descriptions or detailed navigation</li>
                <li>Color contrast adjustments or custom color schemes for those with color vision deficiencies</li>
                <li>Keyboard navigation optimization</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The website primarily focuses on delivering content related to the committee, events, and resources for students in the Computer Engineering (CO) and Artificial Intelligence (AN) departments. We have not implemented accessibility features to support users with visual disabilities, and the content may not be accessible to them.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Intended Audience</h2>
            <p>This website is intended to serve the students and faculty of the Computer Engineering and Artificial Intelligence departments at Government Polytechnic Ch. Sambhajinagar. It is not optimized or designed to meet accessibility guidelines for users with disabilities, particularly for blind users or those using assistive technologies.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Future Accessibility Plans</h2>
            <p>At this time, we do not have plans to implement significant accessibility features on the website. We recommend that users seeking accessible information contact the committee directly for alternative access to content.</p>
            
            <p>This website is maintained by the committee members of ASCE and AIDIAS. For contact details, please refer to the footer section of the website.</p>
